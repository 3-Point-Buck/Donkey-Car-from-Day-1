# Donkey-Car-from-Day-1
Two different sets of information to start with Donkey Car from scratch. One is based on 4 weeks and one is based on 6 weeks.
These are breakouts that would be used in a classroom setting with the assumption that the "students" have no idea about 
anything to do with AI.

Each week not only has a lesson plan, but it also includes generic code examples for Python and micro-python. This code is
meant as a starting point, not functional code.

This was completed using different online resources such as the Donkey Car website, DIY Robocars website, and ChatGPT.
